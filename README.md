1. Try to guess what each of these code fragments does:

```c
int card_count = 11;                            // assign 11 to card_count
if (card_count > 10)                            // check if the value of card_count is greater than 10
        puts("The deck is hot. Increase bet."); // displays a string of text
```

```c
int c = 10;                                      // assign 10 as the value of c
while (c > 10) {                                 // check if the value of c is greater than 10
        puts("I must not write code in class."); // display a string of text
        c = c - 1;                               // subtract 1 to the current value of c
}
```
